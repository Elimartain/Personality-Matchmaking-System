# Personality Matchmaking System

The Personality Matchmaking System is a Python-based project designed to match individuals based on their personality traits. By analyzing responses to a set of personality questions, the system pairs individuals with the most compatible partners.

## Introduction

In various contexts such as dating platforms, team building, or roommate matching, compatibility in personality traits plays a crucial role. The Personality Matchmaking System provides an automated solution to this problem. By leveraging machine learning techniques, it identifies potential matches among a group of individuals based on their personality profiles.

## How it Works

The system follows these main steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Users provide responses to a series of personality questions. These responses are stored in a CSV file, serving as the dataset for matchmaking.

2. **Data Processing**: The system reads the dataset and converts each individual's responses into a numerical vector representation.

3. **Matching Algorithm**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated between pairs of individuals' personality vectors. Lower MSE indicates higher similarity in personalities. Pairs with MSE below a predefined threshold are considered potential matches.

4. **Output**: The system generates a list of matched pairs along with their corresponding MSE scores. This information is saved in an Excel file for further analysis or presentation.

## Files Included

- **`persons1.csv`**: Sample dataset containing individuals' personality responses.
- **`matchmaking.py`**: Python script implementing the matchmaking algorithm.
- **`output.xlsx`**: Excel file containing matched pairs and their MSE scores.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn).
3. Place your dataset (CSV file) in the project directory.
4. Run `matchmaking.py`.
5. Find the output Excel file (`output.xlsx`) containing the matched pairs.
